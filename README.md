#  Codepuppy

## Dead project, not maintained.

The next generation of the CS198 program's website.

## Setup and running the server.

[Setup instructions are
here](https://github.com/cs198/codepuppy/wiki/Setup)

To run the development server, just enter `rails server` in the project
directory. Yay!

## Running tests

After setting up, just run `rake test`. Voila!

**NOTE**: test coverage is literally nothing right now. Stay tuned!
