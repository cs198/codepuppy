[insert title here] is an integrated code submission and grading platform
designed for use in CS106 classes.

#  Project Goals
###Basic Goals (near-Paperless baseline):
* View the students and section leaders in a class
* View the students assigned to a section leader
* Enable students to submit code in a simple manner
* Gracefully integrate with cs198.stanford.edu
* Graders can enter inline comments on students code
* Enable graders to download their students submissions
* Support Eclipse code submission tool for 106A

###Advanced Goals (non-Autograding):
* Automate the reporting of a students bucket grade (style/functionality)
* Automate the counting of late days
* Verify that a students code builds correctly when they submit
* Support MOSS integration and simplify plagiarism detection

###Advanced Goals (Autograding):
* Define a simple format for autograder scripts
* Support automatically building and running students code with the autograder
* Show students why they missed autograders points (maybe)
* Allow a section leader to change student code and re-run the autograder

###General:
* Successfully deploy in a CS106\* class by Spring 2014
* Structure project for easy updates and changes once authors graduate
* Communicate the purpose of this project with section leaders

TBD pending hangout
